My first attempt at using LaTeX. I used a template I found here on GitHub (https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV), with the permission of the owner, replaced his information with mine, and made some tweeks. View my resume by selecting the resume.pdf file. 

Download resume.pdf and try clicking on a few of the items under my name!
